QLedMatrix Widget
-----------------

      The QLedMatrix widget simulates a LED matrix (dot matrix) display.

      A LED matrix display is a 2-dimensional array of dots used to generate
      characters, symbols and images. It is often seen on machines, clocks and
      display boards.

      This generic implementation can configured for any size of rows (greater
      than 0) and columns. The number of colors is not limited, therefore it
      can be used to make a monochrome, bi-color or even a full RGB display.

      Individual LEDs can be addressed in the matrix by their row and column
      position. The index (0,0) is located in the upper left corner. Columns
      grow from left to right, and rows grow from top to bottom.

Installation
------------

      QLedMatrix library:
        qmake
        make
        make install (or copy the plugin into "<Qt4 dir>/plugins/designer")

      QLedMatrix example:
        cd example
        qmake
        make

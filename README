Use of AQModBus:

AQModBus was designed to provide a portable mobile ModBus debug application
for the Android platform, ideally on smartphones and tablets.  It has been
tested to run on Android AVD emulators, an Android phone (HTC Aria), Linux
(openSUSE 11.4 64-bit), Symbian emulator, and Maemo emulator.  To submit bug
reports, feature requests, and add to the known hardware compatibility list
(HCL), email Mark at makr@makrit.net and include AQModBus in the subject line.
Currently ModBus TCP is the only implementation, and that is not expected to
change, although it may if there is enough demand.

I cannot guarantee AQModBus will work on your phone, nor can I guarantee that
it will be suitable to use on your ModBus platform.  Never use a critical
system to test an application.  To install on an Android device make sure to
install Qt libraries first by searching Ministro in the Android Market.  If
you ran Ministro and think it crashed it probably didn't, as it is only used
to check/download the Qt libraries, and then exits without feedback to the
user.  If you have a different platform we assume you know how to install the
required libraries yourself.

AQModBus in its current state is only useful for testing the design and
implementation of a ModBus system, and is not suitable for runtime.

Theoretically this program could run on Windows Mobile as well, but I have not
compiled it yet nor are there plans to in the future.  Anyone is welcome to
submit a packaged version for any platform they wish.

==============================================================================

Future Development:

* UI Themes
* There are no plans to include serial port support at this time
    If someone actually has a mobile platform that needs serial support
    please submit a feature request
* something else but I forgot
* whatever

[really this is about all I expected the program to do, so I'm waiting on feedback]
